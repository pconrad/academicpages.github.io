title: "Partial order transport service for multimedia and other applications"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/001
excerpt: 'Investigates a partial-order connection (POC) service/protocol. Unlike classic transport services that deliver objects either in the exact order transmitted or according to no particular order, POC provides a partial-order service, i.e. a service that requires some, but not all objects to be received in the order transmitted.'
