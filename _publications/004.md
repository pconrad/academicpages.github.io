excerpt:
   >-
   This paper investigates how much the selection of a linear
   extension affects system performance in a partially ordered transport service
   used for
   for multimedia applications.  We first show how to
   identify better linear extensions of a partial order, and then determine the performance
   gains by using such linear extensions at the time of transmission.
