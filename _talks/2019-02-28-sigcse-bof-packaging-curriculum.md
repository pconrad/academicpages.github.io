# Abstract

Packaging materials is a generalized term to capture a broad array of
tasks (creating, revising, sharing, finding, crediting, etc.) for
materials such as assignments, teacher notes, and evaluation
data. Substantial effort has gone into creating materials over the
years, but the community still struggles to find ways to effectively
manage these. This BoF provides an opportunity to identify needs,
concerns, prior efforts, and future plans. A primary goal is the
formation of a Working Group tasked to develop a standard for
curricular material creation and sharing, joining with broader efforts
of standardization (e.g., CSSPLICE) and existing initiatives for
creating repositories, tools, and materials.
