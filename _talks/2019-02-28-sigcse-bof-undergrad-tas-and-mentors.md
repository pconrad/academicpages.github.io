Co-facilitator of a "Birds of a Feather" session, together with:
* [Diba Mirza](https://cs.ucsb.edu/~dimirza)(UC Santa Barbara)
* [Colleen Lewis](http://blogs.hmc.edu/lewis/)(Harvey Mudd College)
* [Cynthia Lee](https://profiles.stanford.edu/48960)(Stanford University)

Undergraduates have been an important part of the teaching staff at
many universities for decades, but this is not a universal
practice. This BOF provides a forum to discuss undergraduate TA/mentor
programs at various stages in their evolution. Attendees will have an
opportunity to discuss the benefits, best practices, and research
questions related to the use of undergraduates as teaching assistants
and/or mentors. The audience is expected to consist of faculty that
have already implemented such programs, and those who might be
considering doing so, and want to share information about successes
and challenges.

Discussion Leader(s): Phill Conrad will facilitate the discussion and
invite Colleen Lewis, Cynthia Lee and Diba Mirza to briefly speak
about the Undergraduate TA/Mentor programs at their respective
institutions. During the balance of the time participants will be
invited to contribute ideas or ask questions related to the use of
undergraduate TAs and mentors.

Expertise of Discussion Leader(s): Diba Mirza and Phill Conrad are
faculty in the Computer Science department at UC Santa Barbara, where
they have created an undergraduate mentor program in the past two
years. Colleen Lewis is an Associate Professor of CS at Harvey Mudd
College, and is the lead PI for the csteachingtips.org project, a
project to collect and document CS pedagogical content
knowledge. Cynthia Lee is a Lecturer in CS at Stanford University, and
works closely with the longstanding undergraduate TA program in the
department.
