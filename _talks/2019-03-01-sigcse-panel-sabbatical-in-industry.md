# Abstract

We believe that more Computing faculty should spend some time in
industry in order to experience for themselves the types of jobs their
students are likely to take at graduation and throughout their
careers. Each panelist has spent at least one sabbatical in industry
and found the experience to be far more beneficial than
anticipated. We all found that our sabbatical experiences helped us to
(1) develop our skills, (2) discover and practice the skills that are
currently being used in industry, (3) gain credibility with our
students, (4) improve our understanding of the computing profession
beyond software development, and (5) build relationships with local
businesses. Many of us returned to the classroom thinking "I can't
believe they let me teach college without any industry experience".

# Summary of my talk

I spent the Summer of 2014 working as an “intern” for
[AppFolio](https://www.appfolio.com/), a Software as a Service (SaaS)
startup near Santa Barbara, Cali- fornia. Rather than take a formal
sabbatical, I asked AppFolio if they would be willing to offer me a
"summer internship" in which I would have the same experience as an
entry-level developer with a B.S. degree (i.e., my typical student).

During my time at AppFolio, I worked on two different teams as a Rails
developer. I experienced many moments of humility as two of my first
team members were former students who were now teaching me advanced
concepts of agile, test design (including mocking and stubbing),
continuous integration, and design patterns (to name just a few). By
the sixth week, I was feeling confident in my ability to "pull my
weight" in helping the team to complete each sprint. I came away with
a renewed appreciation of the importance of the fundamentals we teach,
but also a renewed ability to relate those fundamentals to current
real world practices and career opportunities, to better motivate my
students.
