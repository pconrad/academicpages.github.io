The goal of the session is to help attendees who are committed to
diversity and inclusion learn to talk about different dimensions of
identity (e.g., race, class, gender, sex, sexuality, etc.). The
landscape of terms is always changing and we want SIGCSE attendees to
feel more comfortable using current language to talk about issues
related to diversity and inclusion. This special session will include
six lightning talks, individual reflection, small-group discussion,
and a Q&A with presenters. This is a reprise of a special session held
at the NCWIT Summit in 2018; it was well received and we hope to offer
it to the larger SIGCSE audience.



# Gender and Sexuality

Are gender, sex and sexuality issues in the CS classroom? We address
this with real-world stories. We discuss the benefits of sharing one's
pronouns (she/her/hers vs. he/him/his vs. they/them/their) and
inviting students to share theirs. We identify four aspects of
personal identify: sex, gender identity, gender expression and sexual
orientation, and invite attendees to discuss:

* "Someone left their umbrella; I hope they get it."  Is this sentence
  grammatically correct? What is your level of comfort with the
  singular they?
* We may ask students: "What are your preferred gender pronouns" or
  may simply ask "what are your pronouns".  Discuss: pros/cons, why it
  might matter.
* Which aspects of personal identity (sex, gender identity, gender
  expression and sexual orientation) are you the most (or least)
  comfortable discussing, and why?
* Cameron uses the pronouns “they/them/their.” Try using Cameron’s
  name and their pronouns in a sentence.
